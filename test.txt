UNIT TESTS:
1. A function called “multiplication” that returns the product of the two input numbers.
- Expect multiplication(1, 2) to be a number
- Expect multiplication(-2, 4) to be equal to -2 * 4 (which is equal to -8)
- Expect multiplication(1, “a”) to be an error
- Expect multiplication(1.2, 2) to be equal to 2.4

2. A function called "concatOdds" takes two arrays of integers as arguments. It should return a single array that only contains the odd numbers, in ascending order, from both of the arrays.
- Expect concatOdds([3, 2, 1], [9, 1, 1 ,1 ,4, 15, -1]) to be [-1, 1, 3, 9, 15]
- Expect concatOdds(["a", 2], [4, 24]) to be an error
- Expect concatOdds([NaN, " ", 1], [2, 4, -1]) to be an error
- Expect concatOdds([2, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6]) to be no odds in arguments
